# PyBer_Analysis

#

## Purpose:
### The purpose of this project is to analyze the rideshare data provided by PyBer. A summary of the data shows the total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). A multiline graph shows the total fare earned each week per each city type from January to April in 2019.


## Results:
### The PyBer summary shows that Rural cities have the lowest total number of rides, total drivers, and total fares. However, they have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Urban cities have the highest total number of rides, total drivers, and total fares. However, they have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. It is also interesting to note that the average fare per driver is higher than the average fare per ride in both Rural and Suburban cities, but Urban cities have a higher average fare per ride than average fare per driver.

### In the multiline graph, we can visualize the differences between city types based on the total fare earned each week. Urban cities consistently have the highest total fare each week, Rural cities have the lowest, and Suburban cities land in between.

## Summary:
### Based on the results from the analysis, there are three business recommendations that I recommend.
#### 1) Increase the fare per ride in Urban cities and increase the fare given to each driver.
#### 2) Limit the number of drivers in Urban cities. The total number drivers in Urban cities is higher than the total rides, so there must be drivers who didnâ€™t give any rides.
#### 3) Increase the number of rides in Rural and Suburban cities in order to increase the total fares.
